          <p className="text-base leading-relaxed">
            Parkinson's disease is a progressive neurological disorder that
            affects movement. It occurs when certain nerve cells in the brain
            deteriorate, leading to a reduction in dopamineâ€”a key neurotransmitter
            responsible for controlling movement. Common symptoms include
            tremors, stiffness, and difficulty with balance and coordination.
          </p>
          <p className="text-base leading-relaxed">
            Early diagnosis is critical, as it allows for timely intervention
            that can improve the quality of life for patients. However,
            Parkinson's disease can be challenging to diagnose in its early
            stages, as symptoms may be subtle or mistaken for other conditions.

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold">What Does Our Model Do?</h2>
          <p className="text-base leading-relaxed">
            Our model leverages state-of-the-art machine learning techniques to
            analyze audio data for early detection of Parkinson's disease. By
            examining subtle variations in voice patterns and other relevant
            features, our model can assist healthcare providers in identifying
            potential cases of Parkinson's disease with higher accuracy and
            speed.
          </p>
          <p className="text-base leading-relaxed">
            Specifically, our model focuses on analyzing audio samples to detect
            early signs of vocal impairment, which is often an early indicator of
            Parkinson's disease. With this technology, we aim to provide a
            non-invasive, accessible, and scalable diagnostic tool that supports
            clinicians in their efforts to diagnose and treat this condition.
